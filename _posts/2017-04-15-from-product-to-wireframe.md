Wireframe goal should be to focus on the “why” of the product. The design and UX should focus on the “how”.

Recently I was planning to clean up the UX and add some new features to an old mobile app of mine: **Bike Plus NYC** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bike-plus-nyc/id881296492)
 | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fabriziogiordano.bikeplusnyc&hl=en).

I started by taking some screenshots of the current app and then importing them in [Sketch](https://twitter.com/sketchapp).

After few iterations and new artboards and I realized I needed add phone frame around those to give a little bit more perspective.

I had 3 options:

- **Manually** edit each artboard. Tedious and boring activity. And not easy to switch from an iPhone case to an Android case. **No go**;
- **Write a Sketch plugin** that parses each artboard, add a new layer, apply the case and then skew all other layers to fit into the screen area. **Overkill**;
- **Write a simple script** that just combines 2 images. Computers are good at this tasks. **Yes go**;

I opted for a simple script.

The script had to combine the artboard and a phone case:

I wrote a quick script which magically handled the work:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fabriziogiordano/2409dc6decf700199054.js"></script>

I just had to export the artboards and run a script.
All artboards were stored in *./composite* folder and wrapped in a nice phone frame.

The colors were distracting. So I applied a filter to the artboards to remove the colors.

*convert* has a nice *grayscale* filter out of the box. I just had to add these few lines:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fabriziogiordano/faa07708099efbe678e3.js"></script>

Here the final result:

I can keep working in Sketch and import these new images in a presentation or on storyboard like this one:

See you next time.
