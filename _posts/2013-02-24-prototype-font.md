excerpt: Prototype webapp using distraction free font

Today I had an idea and I immediately play with a prototype.

I was creating some demo pages adding some defaul [lorem ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) text.
Lorem ipsum text is a good starting point. There are other funny Lorem like [baconipsum.com](http://baconipsum.com/) or [lorizzle.nl](http://lorizzle.nl/) or [beeripsum.com](http://beeripsum.com/) .

However I was looking for something more abstract and I got into this project [Redacted Font](https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/fabriziogiordano/5033660.js"></script>


The result is a page with abstract text like this example:
