title: Luhn10 algorithm
excerpt: Luhn10 algorithm
---


I just discovered today an intersting Gist from [Thomas Fuchs](https://gist.github.com/madrobby "Thomas Fuchs").
This is an implementation of the [Luhn 10 algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm "Luhn 10 algorithm")
also known as **"modulus 10"** algorithm.

In this Gist I also learned a new way to convert a string in an integer:

```
d = ~~a[b];
```

nice eh.

Here the gist:
