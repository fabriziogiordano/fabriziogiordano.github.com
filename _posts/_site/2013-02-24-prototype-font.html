<p>Today I had an idea and I immediately play with a prototype.</p>

<p>I was creating some demo pages adding some defaul <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum'>lorem ipsum</a> text. Lorem ipsum text is a good starting point. There are other funny Lorem like <a href='http://baconipsum.com/'>baconipsum.com</a> or <a href='http://lorizzle.nl/'>lorizzle.nl</a> or <a href='http://beeripsum.com/'>beeripsum.com</a> .</p>

<p>However I was looking for something more abstract and I got into this project <a href='https://github.com/christiannaths/Redacted-Font'>Redacted Font</a></p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/fabriziogiordano/5033660.js' />
<p>The result is a page with abstract text like this example:</p>
