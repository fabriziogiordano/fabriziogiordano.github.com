title: Vimeo & Facebook then why not Twitter
excerpt: Vimeo + Twitter = Vimter
---

I was recently reading an interesting [post](http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2015/10/23/why-facebook-should-buy-vimeo-if-it-wants-to-take-on-youtube/) from [Napier Lopes](http://thenextweb.com/author/napierlopez/) about the possibility of Facebook and Vimeo to join forces.

I actually was thinking something similar few weeks ago. This is not the first case of possible integration I fantasized about.

With my team last year we built the [new mobile web experience](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/a-better-vimeo-for-your-mobile-browser) for Vimeo. We release the new version last November 2014. At the beginning of 2015 also Twitter released a new redesigned version of the native iOS Twitter experience.



### Vimeo + Twitter = Vimter
The two experiences look very similar. I thought at the possibility of the two company to join and create a completely new video centric platform called: Vimter
